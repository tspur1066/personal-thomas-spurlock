    "title": "Ireland: Broken Greatness",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This essay is not meant to be a super formal, well argued essay concerning the ever-shaky relationship between the Irish and English. Nor is it meant to necessarily persuade you, dear reader, of anything. This will mostly consist of me ranting about why the Irish are cool, and perhaps explain why I am not a huge fan of the British (at least with relation to this topic: otherwise they’re pretty cool).\nIn the 5th century, a man named St. Patrick (you may have heard of him) came from Roman-governed England to Ireland as a slave. After converting to Christianity and returning to England, he later went back to Ireland and spread Christianity throughout the island. Though some resisted, generally the pagan Irish welcomed Christianity with open arms, and began to make many missionary trips to mainland Europe and England to spread Christianity. This backwater island became a hotbed of Catholic Christianity.\nMany of the Christians in Ireland took the monastic life: the most famous monastery founded by these monks is probably Lindisfarne in northern England, founded by St. Aidan, an Irish missionary. Monasteries were the centers of culture, education, and history in Medieval Europe, and they played an important role in preserving the knowledge of Classical Greece and Roman civilization, and the Irish monasteries greatly contributed to this. Cicero, the Scriptures, and many other documents and writings were preserved and copied, and such copies can be seen in many Psalters, Gospels, and other documents preserved since that time. Many of these monasteries and churches are still standing today (though many were destroyed by Viking raids).\nLike the rest of Europe, the Irish were defined by their dedication to the Christian faith. The Irish church implemented private (1-on-1 with the priest) confession, now practiced everywhere, and the Catholic population has remained as a majority (around 76% last I checked), whereas Germany, England, and especially France have been heavily secularized. The belligerent population has mostly remained steadfast.\nHowever, Ireland is not nearly as prominent nowadays as it was back then. What happened? Well, the British happened, that’s what. While the peoples of the two islands have undoubtedly been in contact for millenia, probably since before recorded history, I would like to start with the 12th-century invasions of Ireland. King Henry II began the famed 800 year conflict between the two islands, invading via a proxy in Dermot MacMurragh, who promised to give Irish land to Henry if he was aided in regaining the throne of Leinster, from which he had been deposed. King Edward II carried on his great-great-grandfather’s aggression and asserted further control over the Irish, kickstarting the English idea of the “backwards Irishman”, a poor, unruly, savage brute whom the English colonists of Ireland were not to associate with. However true (stereotypes exist for a reason) or untrue such an image may be, it inspired great disdain among the English for the people of “England’s Sidecar”.\nFast-forward about 230 or so years, and the Protestant Reformation took place. While technically not aligning himself with Martin Luther and the other Reformers, Henry VIII nonetheless separated from the Catholic Church because his hormones were at an all time high and he just couldn’t help himself. The Irish, on the other hand, remained staunchly Catholic, and the English weren’t big fans of this. In the bloody times following the Reformation, much blood was shed on both the Catholic and Protestant sides, and the emnity between the Irish and English only deepened. The two sides now were on opposite sides of religion, where at least before there had been a commonality, not helped by Henry’s dissolving of monasteries, thereby singlehandedly instituting the idea of “deserving and undeserving poor”.\nAbout 100 years later, everything became much worse. Oliver Cromwell, the so-called “Lord Protector”, began cracking down on the Irish Catholics. MANY priests and those of the laity were killed for their Catholicism. One incident reports Cromwell sieging an Irish town, promising hospitality and mercy if the priests hiding within should give themselves up, and proceeding to burn the town and to execute the priests. Such hostilites towards Catholics endured for all of Cromwell’s reign, and the sentiment remained for even longer.\nLastly, in more recent times, in the mid-1800’s, the Great Irish Famine took place. A good part of the population passed away due to a potato famine, a terrible occurance, since the potato was the major food item of Ireland. Thousands either starved to death or migrated elsewhere, and the whole time Anglo-Irishmen continued to export wheat and other crops…somehow. In addition, the Irish sought help from the English, but the English refused, most likely out of a sense of superiority. Thankfully (at least for those of us of Irish descent), many Irish migrated to America to escape the famine, but the deaths and migration permanently changed the population. Things had reached a boiling point, and eventually the Irish gained independence in the early 20th century. Hopefully one day Northern Ireland will join the rest of the island in one nation.\nRegardless, the conflicts between the English and Irish throughout history have instilled great emnity between the two islands, and that has passed on to our day and age, where the two nations are more at peace. The Irish are a stubborn folk, and their dislike for the English will most likely never go away. As a fellow of Irish descent myself, I certainly feel that disdain, if only mildly. Either way, the Irish have remained stalwart through all the hardship they’ve been through, and they have remained a bulwark of Christianity since St. Patrick began preaching in the early 5th century. May Ireland’s sons be true to her forevermore!!"

From there, while the iterable “i” is less than 7, the length of the last line of the triangle, another # is added onto “symbol”, and each addition is printed to the console. Thus, if we were to run the code, each iteration of “symbol” would be printed to the console."

    "section": "Interests",
    "text": "Interests\nAs one may be able to guess from the above description of my ancestry, I have an interest in genealogy. However, this stems from my greatest interest: history, and specifically, Classics.\nThe exploits of the Greeks and Romans have demanded my attention ever since I was a young lad. Having attended the same small classical Christian school for my whole pre-college life, I grew up studying Latin and later Greek, reading the Bible, and learning the history of Western Civilization and how we got to the point we find ourselves at today.\nNaturally, having studied Western history, I have studied the history of Christianity (being a Christian), as the two are inseparably linked. This leads me to my other favorite area of study: Christianity and theology. Originally attending a Baptist church as a baby, then being a heretical Lutheran (I won’t get into it here), I now am in the process of being confirmed into the Roman Catholic Church. The history of Europe is the history of Christendom, and to study one without the other is not seeing the whole picture. Christianity shapes the way every Western nation thinks, even if one denies it or attempts to separate itself from Christianity.\nThe combination of the study of Christianity and the West, both with their tales and epics of great heroes, monsters, saints, nations, and wars has shaped my perception of life around me. One could say I am a Romantic. I dream of a time of heroes like Achilles, Gothic cathedrals, exploration of new lands, and Arthurian adventures, even as we see each one of those things seemingly vanishing from the public consciousness and concern. It makes life much more interesting, and more worth living (which aren’t the only reasons I believe they are what is important, of course). But I digress.\nAside from the aforementioned areas of study, I also have an interest in computer science and programming. Though I dream and long for the past, that does not prevent me from recognizing that the age we live in is one of technology. Though I fear the machine, I must face it in some form or fashion. That’s why and how you’re reading this little blurb, if you didn’t know!\nMy favorite book is The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri. This is the version I read, which is good, but the Dorothy Sayers version has great notes and is translated by a Catholic, so everything should be accurate for the most part. I believe this is the crown jewel of not just Medieval literature, but also perhaps of Christian literature (aside from the Bible) in general. Aside from that, some of my other favorite works include the Summa Theologia of St. Thomas Aquinas, Orthodoxy by G.K. Chesterton (both of which greatly influenced how I think) and The Aeneid of Virgil, the greatest pre-Christian epic. Highly recommend checking out all of them.\nAnyway, hopefully that tells you enough about me. Enjoy your time here on the site!\n–Thomas"

    "section": "The Problem",
    "text": "The Problem\n“We’ve seen that % (the remainder operator) can be used to test whether a number is even or odd by using % 2 to see whether it’s divisible by two. Here’s another way to define whether a positive whole number is even or odd:\n-Zero is even.\n-One is odd.\n-For any other number N, its evenness is the same as N - 2.\nDefine a recursive function isEven corresponding to this description. The function should accept a single parameter (a positive, whole number) and return a Boolean.\nTest it on 50 and 75. See how it behaves on -1. Why? Can you think of a way to fix this?”\nWhat Haverbeke is asking the strapping young reader to do here is to create a function that, using recursion, determines whether a number is even or not. It must return either TRUE or FALSE, and it must determine evenness by using the N - 2 technique: if a whole number, when subtracted by 2 enough times, eventually equals 0, it is even, or eventually equals 1, it is odd."

    "section": "The Solution to Part 1",
    "text": "The Solution to Part 1\nFirst, we define the function isEven:\nconst isEven = function(x) {\n    if (x &lt; 0) {\n        return console.log(\"!!!!x must be a positive number!!!!\");\n    }\n    if (x == 1) {\n        return console.log(false);\n    } else if (x == 0) {\n        return console.log(true);\n    } else return isEven(x - 2);\n}\nisEven is a function accepting a single positive number, x, that returns either “true” if the number is even, or “false” if the number is odd. But let’s break it down:\nWe first set up a “negative gate”, as I’ll call it:\n\nif (x &lt; 0) {\n    return console.log(\"!!!!x must be a positive number!!!!\");\n}\nThe function first tests whether the number x is a negative number. If so, it prints an angry error message to the console.\nNext, we need to define a “base cases”, or in other words, the criteria needed for the funtion to return a desired outcome. For this function, we need to define two base cases, one for if x = 1 (that is, it’s odd), and another for x = 0 (it is even).\n\nif (x == 1) {\n       return console.log(false);\n   } else if (x == 0) {\n       return console.log(true);\nIf x ends up being equal to 1, the function prints “false” to the console, and if x is equal to 0, “true” is printed to the console.\nNow we get to the fun part: recursion! The main function of the isEven function is to use N (or x) - 2 to find out whether, if 2 is subtracted enough times, N - 2 eventually equals 1 or 0. That looks like this:\n\nif (x == 1) {\n        return console.log(false);\n    } else if (x == 0) {\n        return console.log(true);\n    } else return isEven(x - 2);\n}\nIf x manages to make it by both base cases, the function will rerun isEven using x -2. So, for example, if we make x = 2, it would first pass by both base cases, then rerun isEven where x = 0, instead. Since x = 0 is one of the base cases, the console would then print “true”."

    "text": "The Solution to Part 2\nHowever, we aren’t done yet. The problem also asks us to figure out why inputting a negative value for x does not work. The reason for this is because negative numbers are less than both 0 and 1, so the N - 2 method will not work. We could either add an angry error message if x is a negative number, or we can adjust isEven to account for negative numbers. This is negisEven. Say hello!\n\nconst negisEven = function(x) {\n    if (x &lt; 0) {\n        let neg_x = -x;\n        if (neg_x == 1) {\n            return console.log(false);\n        } else if (neg_x == 0) {\n            return console.log(true);\n        }\n            else return negisEven(neg_x - 2)\n    }\n    if (x == 1) {\n        return console.log(false);\n    } else if (x == 0) {\n        return console.log(true);\n    } else return negisEven(x - 2);\n}\nThis function is identical to isEven except in how it handles negative numbers. For our “negative gate”, rather than simply telling you to buzz off, the following takes place:\n\nif (x &lt; 0) {\n        let neg_x = -x;\n        if (neg_x == 1) {\n            return console.log(false);\n        } else if (neg_x == 0) {\n            return console.log(true);\n        }\n            else return negisEven(neg_x - 2)\n    }\nneg_x is equal to the inverse of x, i.e., -x. The function then uses the same testing as isEven: if neg_x is equal to 0, “true” is printed to the console, and if neg_x is equal to 1, then “false” is printed to the console. And if neg_x is equal to neither of those, negisEven is run again, where x is set equal to neg_x. Functionality is identical to isEven after that."

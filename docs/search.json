If curious, it lives here, and it is usually welcoming to visitors.\n“We’ve seen that % (the remainder operator) can be used to test whether a number is even or odd by using % 2 to see whether it’s divisible by two. Here’s another way to define whether a positive whole number is even or odd:\n-Zero is even.\n-One is odd.\n-For any other number N, its evenness is the same as N - 2.\nDefine a recursive function isEven corresponding to this description. The function should accept a single parameter (a positive, whole number) and return a Boolean.\nTest it on 50 and 75. See how it behaves on -1. Why? Can you think of a way to fix this?”\nWhat Haverbeke is asking the strapping young reader to do here is to create a function that, using recursion, determines whether a number is even or not. It must return either TRUE or FALSE, and it must determine evenness by using the N - 2 technique: if a whole number, when subtracted by 2 enough times, eventually equals 0, it is even, or eventually equals 1, it is odd."

But let’s break it down:\nWe first set up a “negative gate”, as I’ll call it:\n\nif (x &lt; 0) {\n    return console.log(\"!!!!x must be a positive number!!!!\");\n}\nThe function first tests whether the number x is a negative number. If so, it prints an angry error message to the console.\nNext, we need to define a “base cases”, or in other words, the criteria needed for the funtion to return a desired outcome. For this function, we need to define two base cases, one for if x = 1 (that is, it’s odd), and another for x = 0 (it is even).\n\nif (x == 1) {\n       return console.log(false);\n   } else if (x == 0) {\n       return console.log(true);\nIf x ends up being equal to 1, the function prints “false” to the console, and if x is equal to 0, “true” is printed to the console.\nNow we get to the fun part: recursion!

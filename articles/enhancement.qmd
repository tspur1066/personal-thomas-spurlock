title: "Major Enhancement: Random Button"
---

This is an article describing the major enhancement to this website: the "random webpage" button on the home page. While debatably not a "major enhancement", it took me forever, it uses Javascript, and it's kinda neat, so hopefully that checks a few of the boxes.

## The "Problem"

Dr. White asked that we make a major enhancement to our warmup website that involved either Javascript or css. I chose the former and added in some HTML to go along with it.


## The Solution

Let's start by setting up the HTML. It is as follows:

```.html

You can also click  
<div id="button">
    <button id = "random" type="button" class="btn btn-primary">this button
        <script src="js/random.js"></script>
    </button>
</div>
 to be taken to a random page.
<br>
<br>
```

A button is created with the "random" id so that we can, well, choose a random webpage. It is given that id so that random.js (put in as the script for the button) can identify what it needs to look for in our document selector, which we'll talk about later. The button will say "this button", and using Bootstrap, we can make it visible on our black background. Two spacers are added at the end to separate the text that comes after the button on the actual webpage.


Regarding Javascript, we first need to define a function through which we can create a random process. The mdn_ web docs kindly gave the following code to find an integer from a range of numbers:

```.js

function getRandomNum(min, max) {
    min = Math.ceil(min);
    max = Math.floor(max);
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1) + min);
}

```

We first bind Math.ceil(min) to min and Math.floor(max) to max. Math.ceil and Math.floor are opposites: the former rounds the entered value up and returns the integer greater than or equal to that number, while the latter rounds the entered value down and returns the integer less than or equal to that number. So, for example, Math.floor(6.3) would return 6, while Math.ceil(6.3) would return 7.

What this function does is first set the entered max and min values to their nearest integers. After that, a random value between 0 and 1, chosen via Math.random, distributes itself to (max-min+1), added to the min value, and then is rounded down to the nearest integer. This ensures that the value returned is an integer, and it is possible for both the upper and lower bounds of the range to be returned. We will use this function to randomly select one of the values in an array.


Next, since we're working with HTML, we should define the document selector and event listener for our random button:

```.js



```

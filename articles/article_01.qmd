title: "Looping a Triangle in Javascript"
---

This problem is taken from *Eloquent Javascript*. You can find it [here](https://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html#i_umoXp9u0e7){target="_blank"}. Let's see what it says:

## The Problem

"Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:

```.js
#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######
```

(but without the apostrophes)."

## The Solution

Here is the full code for the triangle:

```.js

let symbol = "#";
for (let length = symbol.length; symbol.length <= 7; symbol += "#") {
    console.log(symbol)
}

```

The idea behind this solution is utilizing a simple for-loop. "symbol" is set equal to #, as that is the first line. From there, while the iterable "i" is less than 7, the length of the last line of the triangle, another # is added onto "symbol", and each addition is printed to the console. Thus, if we were to run the code, each iteration of "symbol" would be printed to the console.

## The Javascript File

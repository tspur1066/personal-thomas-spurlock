This essay is not meant to be a super formal, well argued essay concerning the ever-shaky relationship between the Irish and English. Nor is it meant to necessarily persuade you, dear reader, of anything. This will mostly consist of me ranting about why the Irish are cool, and perhaps explain why I am not a huge fan of the British (at least with relation to this topic: otherwise they're pretty cool).

In the 5th century, a man named St. Patrick (you may have heard of him) came from Roman-governed England to Ireland as a slave. After converting to Christianity and returning to England, he later went back to Ireland and spread Christianity throughout the island. Though some resisted, generally the pagan Irish welcomed Christianity with open arms, and began to make many missionary trips to mainland Europe and England to spread Christianity. The backwater island, unconquered by the Romans and at the edge of the known world, became a hotbed of Catholic Christianity.

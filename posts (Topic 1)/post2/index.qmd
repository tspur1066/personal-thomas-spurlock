This essay is not meant to be a super formal, well argued essay concerning the ever-shaky relationship between the Irish and English. Nor is it meant to necessarily persuade you, dear reader, of anything. This will mostly consist of me ranting about why the Irish are cool, and perhaps explain why I am not a huge fan of the British (at least with relation to this topic: otherwise they're pretty cool).

In the 5th century, a man named St. Patrick (you may have heard of him) came from Roman-governed England to Ireland as a slave. After converting to Christianity and returning to England, he later went back to Ireland and spread Christianity throughout the island. Though some resisted, generally the pagan Irish welcomed Christianity with open arms, and began to make many missionary trips to mainland Europe and England to spread Christianity. This backwater island became a hotbed of Catholic Christianity.

Many of the Christians in Ireland took the monastic life: the most famous monastery founded by these monks is probably Lindisfarne in northern England, founded by St. Aidan, an Irish missionary. Monasteries were the centers of culture, education, and history in Medieval Europe, and they played an important role in preserving the knowledge of Classical Greece and Roman civilization, and the Irish monasteries greatly contributed to this. Cicero, the Scriptures, and many other documents and writings were preserved and copied, and such copies can be seen in many Psalters, Gospels, and other documents preserved since that time. Many of these monasteries and churches are still standing today (though many were destroyed by Viking raids).

Like the rest of Europe, the Irish were defined by their dedication to the Christian faith. The Irish church implemented private (1-on-1 with the priest) confession, now practiced everywhere, and the Catholic population has remained as a majority (around 76% last I checked), whereas Germany, England, and especially France have been heavily secularized. The belligerent population has mostly remained steadfast.

However, Ireland is not nearly as prominent nowadays as it was back then. What happened? Well, the British happened, that's what. While the peoples of the two islands have undoubtedly been in contact for millenia, probably since before recorded history, I would like to start with the 12th-century invasions of Ireland. King Henry II began the famed 800 year conflict between the two islands, invading via a proxy in Dermot MacMurragh, who promised to give Irish land to Henry if he was aided in regaining the throne of Leinster, from which he had been deposed. King Edward II carried on his great-great-grandfather's aggression and asserted further control over the Irish, kickstarting the English idea of the "backwards Irishman", a poor, unruly, savage brute whom the English colonists of Ireland were not to associate with. However true (stereotypes exist for a reason) or untrue such an image may be, it inspired great disdain among the English for the people of "England's Sidecar".

Fast-forward about 230 or so years, and the Protestant Reformation took place. While technically not aligning himself with Martin Luther and the other Reformers, Henry VIII nonetheless separated from the Catholic Church because his hormones were at an all time high and he just couldn't help himself. The Irish, on the other hand, remained staunchly Catholic, and the English weren't big fans of this. In the bloody times following the Reformation, much blood was shed on both the Catholic and Protestant sides, and the emnity between the Irish and English only deepened. The two sides now were on opposite sides of religion, where at least before there had been a commonality, not helped by Henry's dissolving of monasteries, thereby singlehandedly instituting the idea of "deserving and undeserving poor". 

About 100 years later, everything became much worse. Oliver Cromwell, the so-called "Lord Protector", began cracking down on the Irish Catholics. MANY priests and those of the laity were killed for their Catholicism. One incident reports Cromwell sieging an Irish town, promising hospitality and mercy if the priests hiding within should give themselves up, and proceeding to burn the town and to execute the priests. Such hostilites towards Catholics endured for all of Cromwell's reign, and the sentiment remained for even longer.

Lastly, in more recent times, in the mid-1800's, the Great Irish Famine took place. A good part of the population passed away due to a potato famine, a terrible occurance, since the potato was the major food item of Ireland. Thousands either starved to death or migrated elsewhere, and the whole time Anglo-Irishmen continued to export wheat and other crops...somehow. In addition, the Irish sought help from the English, but the English refused, most likely out of a sense of superiority. Thankfully (at least for those of us of Irish descent), many Irish migrated to America to escape the famine, but the deaths and migration permanently changed the population. Things had reached a boiling point, and eventually the Irish gained independence in the early 20th century. Hopefully one day Northern Ireland will join the rest of the island in one nation.

Regardless, the conflicts between the English and Irish throughout history have instilled great emnity between the two islands, and that has passed on to our day and age, where the two nations are more at peace. The Irish are a stubborn folk, and their dislike for the English will most likely never go away. As a fellow of Irish descent myself, I certainly feel that disdain, if only mildly. Either way, the Irish have remained stalwart through all the hardship they've been through, and they have remained a bulwark of Christianity since St. Patrick began preaching in the early 5th century. May Ireland's sons be true to her forevermore!!

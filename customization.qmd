Want to upload a cool new theme for your visit to the website? Just click that button and choose a jpeg from your computer!

```{=html}
<button>Upload Image</button>
<script>
  let button = document.querySelector("button");
  button.addEventListener("click", () => {
    console.log("Button clicked.");
  });
</script>
```

Cool, huh?

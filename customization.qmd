        <strong> Agent Cobra: Original Sin </strong> premiered in theaters (in Louisville) on January 15th, 2022, to a decent sized crowd and positive reception by most who watched it. A prequel to <strong> Agent Cobra: Reborn </strong>, a remake of my friends' homemade movies of youth, <strong> Agent Cobra: Orginal Sin </strong> has the titular agent venture out into the Panamanian jungle in pursuit of the leader of a drug cartel. However, the jungle is a strange place, and those who go in often don't come out quite the same...

        <strong> The Blood of Angels </strong> is a 2024 movie directed by Bobby Fowler and Ryan Torres, neither of whom go to Georgetown, but nonetheless the credit would be appreciated, I'm sure. Taking place in "turn of the century" Oklahoma, <strong> The Blood of Angels </strong> takes inspiration from many Western films, and will hopefully have a theatrical release, as well. Get excited!!

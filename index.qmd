title: "Thomas' COOLER Website"
---

This is a website that I'm making for an assignment for CSC 324 at Georgetown College. Hope this is at least mildly entertaining and, God willing, neat. To the left and top, you can find links to the About page, two articles covering *Eloquent Javascript* problems. You can also access the 404 page by putting whatever in the URL after /personal-thomas-spurlock, if you so desire.

```{=html}
You can also click  
<body>
<div id="button">
    <button id = "random" type="button" class="btn btn-primary">this button
    </button>
</div>
<script src="js/random.js"></script>
</body>
 to be taken to a random page.

```

If you're in the mood, you can also check out [this cool book](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1201.htm){target="_blank"}. Highly recommend.

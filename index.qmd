title: "Thomas' Cool Little Website"
---

This is a website that I'm making for an assignment for CSC 324 at Georgetown College. Hope this is at least mildly entertaining and, God willing, cool.

If you're in the mood, you can also check out [this cool book](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1201.htm){target="_blank"}. Highly recommend.

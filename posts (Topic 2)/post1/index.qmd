The programmer takes a long look at his code...it all seems to be working: his functions are properly bracketed, his variables bound, and his arguments are set. Smiling after a long, draining day of programming, he enters the keyboard shortcut to run his code, and...he is greeted with an error message. On the verge of screaming, he looks through his code. "What's the issue?" he thinks to himself, desperately combing his code for a stray function or missing argument. Unable to find anything, he turns to a powerful tool: the internet.

The poet T.S. Eliot once said: "Dante and Shakespeare divide the world between them. There is no third." Bold words, some might say. But what is it that makes Dante and Shakespeare so great? Is it their masterful poetry, incredibly pleasing to hear and filled with vivid imagery? Was it their philosophies, making profound and beautiful statements about God, Man, and the world? Or was it their great milestones, Dante having written the first epic in Italian, and Shakespeare standardizing the English language?

All the above reasons are true. However, I believe that a large part of their greatness comes from their knowledge and understanding of their predecessors, namely the Classical authors, and their contemporaries. Much of what Dante and Shakespeare wrote was not "original", but they instead borrowed others' work and improved or tweaked it to make something new. And those two were not the only ones to do it: most Medieval and Renaissance authors did the same thing, such as Chaucer translating and reworking Bocaccio, and St. Thomas Aquinas joining Aristotle and God. Reusing and reworking was the name of the game in Medieval Europe: the entire literary and philosophical corpus was to be used by all, and no one thought otherwise. The idea of "originality" as a goal worthy of pursuit is a modern idea.

But what does programming have to do with any of that? Well, computer programmers do the exact same thing: they take each others' works, improve or rework them, and then publish for all to use as they wish. The idea of open source programming is a spiritual successor to the Medieval corpus open to all. Those who hide their work or do not let others use it are looked at with negativity. This very assignment is proof of that: if someone does not know how to do something, or needs help with their code, legions of programmers and code of old is there at one's disposal. And if anything is erroneous or needs improving, anyone may come along and give his own shot at bettering the code.

As Dante and Shakespeare were well aware of their places in a literary culture of borrowing and reworking, so programmers must be aware that the same such opportunities are there all around them. All they have to do is look it up. How else could our poor programmer have figured out he had simply forgotten a semicolon somewhere within his spaghetti plate of code?
